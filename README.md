# Sumo Battle Tap

_The Sumo multiplayer game is a thrilling battle between two sumo-wrestlers. The objective of the game is to push the opponent out of the ring, and the first player to succeed wins the match. The player who has won the most matches out of three matches, wins the game. Each player controls their sumo-wrestler by pressing rapidly on their respective side of the screen, thereby pushing their opponent closer to the ring's edge. The game is inspired by the game Sumo from 2 PlayerGames._

_The gameplay is fast-paced and requires quick reflexes, making it an exciting and engaging experience for players. Get ready to enter the ring and become the ultimate sumo-wrestling champion!_
